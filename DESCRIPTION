Description: Autonomous recording units (ARUs) can be used to record sounds in
    a landscape at certain intervals throughout a day. Increasingly, these are
    used in biological survey situations where we are interested in learning
    occupancy, density, and/or abundance at a site. 'soundDist' allows you to
    estimate distance to sound sources of different North American birds, which
    can then be used for studies related to detection distance estimation, home-
    range analysis, and more.
